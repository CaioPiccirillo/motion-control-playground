# Roadmap

# Phase 1 (v0.1.0):

- [ ] Create a basic Bevy project and import the necessary dependencies.
- [ ] Create a simple 3D scene with a camera and light.
- [ ] Import a 3D model from a third-party software.
- [ ] Display the 3D model in the scene.

# Phase 2 (v0.2.0):

- [ ] Implement a system for adding joints to imported models.
- [ ] Implement a system for controlling joints with keyboard keys.
- [ ] Add support for different types of joints (revolute, fixed, spherical, etc.).
- [ ] Add support for attaching keyboard keys to motors.

# Phase 3 (v0.3.0):

- [ ] Implement more advanced features for controlling joints, such as speed and precision.
- [ ] Add support for multiple joints in a single model.
- [ ] Add support for nested joints.
- [ ] Control spawn camera position and projection.

# Phase 4 (v0.4.0):

- [ ] Add support for more complex interactions between joints.
- [ ] Add support for physics simulation of joints.
- [ ] Add support for networking, so that multiple users can control the joints in a shared scene.

# Phase 5 (v0.5.0):

- [ ] Add additional features and polish, such as a user interface, documentation, and tests.

# Phase 6 (v1.0.0):

- [ ] Release the first stable version of the software.

<!-- 
Error handling: How will you handle errors that occur while loading or controlling the digital twins?
Performance: How will you ensure that the system can run smoothly, even with multiple digital twins in the scene?
Security: How will you prevent unauthorized users from controlling the digital twins?
Documentation: How will you document the system so that other developers can use it?
